SIMPLE-NN (SNU Interatomic Machine-learning PotentiaL packagE â€“ version Neural Network)

SIMPLE-NN is an open package that constructs Behler-Parrinello-type neural-network interatomic potentials from *ab initio* data. The package provides an interfacing module to LAMMPS for MD simulations. 

## Main features
- Training over total energies, forces, and stresses.
- Symmetry function vectors for atomic features
- PCA matrix transformation and whitening of training data for fast and accurate learning. 
- Uniform training for the biased sampling (https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b08063)
- Replica ensemble for quantifying the uncertainty (https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpclett.0c01614)
- Compatible with results of most ab initio codes such as Quantum-Espresso and VASP via ASE module.

## Requirement
- Python: `3.6-3.9`
- LAMMPS: `29Oct2020` or later
