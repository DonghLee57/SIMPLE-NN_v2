- ``0.1`` (default) / ``0.0`` ~ ``1.0``

----

**valid_rate** separates the rate of validation data and training data as a specified value(``0.1``). For example, if the **valid_rate** is set as ``0.1`` 10 % of total data are classified as validation data, and the remaining 90 % data are classified as training data.
