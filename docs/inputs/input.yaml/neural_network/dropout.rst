- ``0`` (default) / ``0`` ~ ``1``

----

The main idea of dropout is to randomly drop units from the neural network during training, resulting in a significant reduction of overfitting. Users must type a value between ``0`` and ``1`` to enable **dropout**. For example, if users type ``0.25``, 25 % of nodes in neural network hidden layers are dropped.
